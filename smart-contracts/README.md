# 🕹️ TicTacToe On-Chain Game

A fully decentralized two-player Tic Tac Toe game built on smart contracts with a modern frontend. Play, win, earn — all on-chain.

## 🧠 Features

### Smart Contracts (Foundry)

- Players can **create**, **join**, **play**, and **cancel** games.
- Games have **entry bets**, and winnings are distributed automatically.

- All logic and funds are handled by the contract.
